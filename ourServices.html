The purpose of mitigation is to not only minimize further damage to the property but to also provide a necessary scope of work that gives a glimpse into the rebuild process that will take place in the near future.

The purpose of mitigation is to not only minimize further damage to the property but to also provide a necessary scope of work that gives a glimpse into the rebuild process that will take place in the near future. Examples of mitigation in a claim involves taking prompt action to prevent and protect from any additional damages and may include: securing the premises, boarding up the property, addressing water leaks and damages, clearing out the damaged property, and/or temporarily fixing damaged structures and contents amongst other actions. Ayzertech has valued relationships with mitigation companies across the country and can help coordinate a swift and efficient mitigation process for our clients. It should be noted that there are mitigation companies out there that are not as professional as they may seem and can actually end up costing you a lot more money by using them. Please contact Ayzertech before you decide on a mitigation plan as it is prudent for us to assist you in not only vetting the mitigation company but also with ensuring that you understand what exact next steps need to be taken that vary with the specific loss that occurred.</p>

Appraisal is a process mandated by insurance law in which either the insured or the insurance company (usually authorized by the insured) can choose to opt out of standard communication and negotiation methods and resolve their disagreements in a similar fashion to arbitration. Once one party formally demands appraisal, an “umpire” or fair, third party is elected and agreed upon by both parties to decide on the eventual outcome of the claim. Once an umpire is decided, usually an inspection of the property is conducted once more with all parties involved and the umpire leads the discussions whereby both parties have to abide by certain deadlines for submission of documentation, responses etc. Ayzertech has a plethora of experience in these matters and has proven to be very successful in the past when appraisal is warranted and initiated. Ayzertech can help guide you throughout this atypical experience and can help choose an umpire and appraiser to advance your claim all the while ensuring to advocate on your behalf every step of the way.</p>

                          <p>Mitigation is a crucial, initial step in the insurance claim process which helps reduce the extent of the loss to the property as is mandated by your insurance policy. The purpose of mitigation is to not only minimize further damage to the property but to also provide a necessary scope of work that gives a glimpse into the rebuild process that will take place in the near future. Examples of mitigation in a claim involves taking prompt action to prevent and protect from any additional damages and may include: securing the premises, boarding up the property, addressing water leaks and damages, clearing out the damaged property, and/or temporarily fixing damaged structures and contents amongst other actions. Ayzertech has valued relationships with mitigation companies across the country and can help coordinate a swift and efficient mitigation process for our clients. It should be noted that there are mitigation companies out there that are not as professional as they may seem and can actually end up costing you a lot more money by using them. Please contact Ayzertech before you decide on a mitigation plan as it is prudent for us to assist you in not only vetting the mitigation company but also with ensuring that you understand what exact next steps need to be taken that vary with the specific loss that occurred.</p>

                          <p>When it happens that a property sustains damage that results in an insurance claim, there is usually a loss or damage to its contents as well. Ayzertech helps evaluate the extent of the damage to ensure nothing is overlooked or undervalued and advocates for you every step of the way. We work closely with vendors and experts to provide a detailed inventory of the damaged items and can even coordinate pack outs; which entail carefully packing, labeling, and moving your contents to a secure storage facility until repairs are conducted. Ayzertech works tirelessly to help navigate the insurance claim process and alleviate the burden of our clients to the best of our ability.</p>

                          <h3><i id="storm" class="fa-solid fa-file-signature hex-icons"></i> Appraisal</h3>
                          <p>Sometimes, negotiations do not always go as planned. Appraisal is a process mandated by insurance law in which either the insured or the insurance company (usually authorized by the insured) can choose to opt out of standard communication and negotiation methods and resolve their disagreements in a similar fashion to arbitration. Once one party formally demands appraisal, an “umpire” or fair, third party is elected and agreed upon by both parties to decide on the eventual outcome of the claim. Once an umpire is decided, usually an inspection of the property is conducted once more with all parties involved and the umpire leads the discussions whereby both parties have to abide by certain deadlines for submission of documentation, responses etc. Ayzertech has a plethora of experience in these matters and has proven to be very successful in the past when appraisal is warranted and initiated. Ayzertech can help guide you throughout this atypical experience and can help choose an umpire and appraiser to advance your claim all the while ensuring to advocate on your behalf every step of the way.</p>

                      <p>Depending on the type of claim, there may be a need to have certain professionals from either the insurance company itself and/or hired on behalf of the insured to inspect and document the property and its associated damages. Ayzertech can help identify that need and can coordinate the use of vendors and experts wherever necessary. Some examples may include the use of structural engineers to inspect damages to trusses and roofs, architects, industrial hygienists to test for smoke and microbial/bacterial compounds, or even forensic accountants and consultants to name a few. Additionally, there may be provisions in your insurance policy that allows for reimbursements for the professional services; and Ayzertech can help you identify that as well.</p>

                    <p>Oftentimes when a business experiences a covered loss, it results in the inability to operate and generate revenue. A public adjuster plays a crucial role in assisting the business owners and operators in recovering their loss of business income from loss of rents or need to vacate the loss location. Ayzertech can evaluate the financial impact of the loss as well as help document and quantify the loss suffered in conjunction with our relationships with forensic accountants throughout the country. We can help guide you in obtaining the necessary financial documentation and relevant records to corroborate your claim. After analyzing your insurance policy to determine the extent of the coverage, we have been successful in even getting these professional fees compensated by the insurance company. Contact Ayzertech to learn more about how we can help you maximize your settlement and even resume normal operations in an efficient and successful manner.</p>
