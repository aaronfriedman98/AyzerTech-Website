													Whether you contact us by phone at 855-CLAIM-55, our contact button below, or email, one of our customer advocates will contact you as soon as possible to schedule your FREE, NO-OBLIGATION consultation. One of our Licensed Public Adjuster will meet with you, either over the phone or in person, to review the details of your situation and explain how we can help. We will answer any questions and explain how the process would proceed if we are hired. We will review the professional fee structure up front with you- there will be no surprises! Typically, fees are a percentage of the total claim- if you don't get paid, we don't get paid. This means that we are highly motivated to do all we can to make sure you get all that you deserve, considering your coverage and limits. Once you decide to hire Ayzertech, we will ask you to sign the legally required agreement and then we will notify the insurance company of the claim.

We will engage specialist, as needed. We work with a company that specializes in content inventory and pricing, completing this process in a fraction of the typical time. We also work with accountants to calculate loss of business calculations, if necessary.

We pride ourselves on our strong relationships we develop with insurance adjusters. We make their lives easier by doing our job well. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the business, we do not always see eye to eye with the insurnace companies. When this occurs, our experience is key. We know how to manage the escalation process, the first step of which is requesting the insurance company's arbitration process, referred to as Appraisal. This process involves neutral parties assessing the claim. We handle this process for you and work with you until your claim is completed. Occasionally, the only recourse is the legal system. We would refer you to an attorney, if needed, and work with them throughout the process.

					<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						<h3><i id="fire" class="fa-solid fa-fire hex-icons"></i> Fire, Flood, Natural Disaster</h3>
						<p>Fire, Flood and Natural disasters are the most common claims we deal with. We guide you through the entire process, from arranging board up and/or water extraction, documentation of the damage, all the way through your final payout.</p>
						<h3><i  id="bolt" class="fa-solid fa-bolt hex-icons"></i> Lightning Strike, Downed Power Line, Fried Appliances</h3>
						<p>It's not enough to just get paid for your damage- Ayzertech will help make sure you are safe after an event occurs. One example is a claim where a downed power line fried all of the customer's appliances, blew out light bulbs, and caused switches to smoke. Ayzertech insisted that the insurance company pay to have a qualified electrician inspect every wire in the house. If not for Ayzertech, the insurance company would not have provided for this, putting the customer at future risk. This is where Ayzertech's experience pays off!</p>
						<h3><i  id="snow" class="fa-solid fa-snowflake hex-icons"></i> Snow, Ice, Hail</h3>
						<p>Often hail storms will cause damage to siding and roofs. You don't have to 'live with the damage.' Many policies cover this damage. Ice dam form on your roof, causing damage? Snow cause a collapse? We handle it.</p>
						
					</div>
					<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
						<h3><i  id="water" class="fa-solid fa-droplet hex-icons"></i> Flooded Basement</h3>
						<p>Basement water coverage may be complex. The extent of your coverage, if any, depends on the origin of the water, type of water damage, etc. If you say the wrong thing to the insurance company you may be denied coverage. Let Ayzertech guide you through this, help you determine if you should be covered and make sure the insurance company pays what you are owed!</p>
						<h3><i  id="person" class="fa-solid fa-person hex-icons"></i> Human</h3>
						<p>Someone drive a car through your picture window? Accidentally cross some wires while hanging a light fixture and blow out some appliances? We walk you through the process. Often people unintentionally cause damage in their homes and don't even check if it's covered because it's their fault- that's what insurance is for!</p>
						<h3><i  id="hazard" class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation hex-icons"></i> Crazy Catastrophe</h3>
						<p>Sometimes the unexpected happens. For one customer it was the exploding of his 350 gallon fish tank. Ayzertech is used to the unexpected and was able to properly handle this unusual situation, from engaging mitigation services to arranging the contents handling and cleaning. Ayzertech handled the entire process, documenting the damage, engaging with the insurance company to make sure the damage was contained, contents handled, and quickly settled and paid.</p>
