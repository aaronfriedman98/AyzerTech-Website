If we feel that you could benefit from using any one of Ayzertech’s services and have determined sufficient coverage based on your insurance policy; we can set up a meeting with one of our licensed Public Adjusters who can then help guide you and outline our potential strategies in attaining a proper resolution to your insurance claim. Please ask as many questions as you can; as we know that for some, this is their first time dealing with something like this and Ayzertech is eager to be a resource for all insurance-related matters. During that meeting, we will discuss and review our professional fee structure so that everyone is on the same page. Fees for a Public Adjuster are always a percentage of the total settlement, which means that we are highly motivated to do everything we can to ensure that we maximize your settlement to the best of our ability. Remember, if you don’t get paid, we don’t either, so we are always on your side throughout the entire process!

In addition to that, we will send you our welcome letter which contains information pertaining to a general insurance claim, as well as a limited Power of Attorney, which allows us to endorse checks submitted from the insurance company to allow us to expedite payments to vendors as needed, including Ayzertech’s commission. At the same time, we will email you requesting specific information pertaining to the claim that we need to help represent you to the insurance company.

We have many deep relationships with vendors across the country and would be happy to assist in finding the right match for you and your specific needs. Usually, in the case of a typical loss, mitigation should be brought in as soon as possible; please reach out to our office so that we may coordinate this aspect of your claim.

                                                Insurance companies have strict requirements regarding how a loss must be documented. These requirements vary by company and by adjuster assigned to each claim.  As in most claims, it becomes necessary for Ayzertech to be your eyes and ears and understand exactly what occurred during the period of loss. A member of our team will travel to the job site as soon as possible to properly document the loss through various specialized software and industry approved equipment, to ensure we have everything we need to make our case to the insurance company.

We will then present our estimate to the insurance company with all the appropriate documentation to clearly show how your coverage applies to your claim. Throughout our constant communication with the insurance company, we then negotiate on your behalf to reach a fair and equitable settlement. We pride ourselves on our strong relationships with insurance company adjusters across the country. Oftentimes, if we are involved from the beginning, negotiations go smoothly; although sometimes there are instances where we do not always see eye to eye with the insurance companies and/or their representatives. When this occurs, our experience is key. We understand how to manage the escalation process and have various tools at our disposal to ensure that you are being taken care of. We will be in touch with you if other methods of settlement become necessary such as arbitration, appraisal, or litigation; and have many experts at our disposal to assist throughout these processes.

                                <p>
                                    Whether you contact us by phone at 248-200-5071 or message us through our website, one of our talented team members will contact you as soon as possible to learn more about your potential insurance claim and explain how Ayzertech may be of assistance. If we feel that you could benefit from using any one of Ayzertech’s services and have determined sufficient coverage based on your insurance policy; we can set up a meeting with one of our licensed Public Adjusters who can then help guide you and outline our potential strategies in attaining a proper resolution to your insurance claim. Please ask as many questions as you can; as we know that for some, this is their first time dealing with something like this and Ayzertech is eager to be a resource for all insurance-related matters. During that meeting, we will discuss and review our professional fee structure so that everyone is on the same page. Fees for a Public Adjuster are always a percentage of the total settlement, which means that we are highly motivated to do everything we can to ensure that we maximize your settlement to the best of our ability. Remember, if you don’t get paid, we don’t either, so we are always on your side throughout the entire process!

                                <p>
                                    Once you give us the go-ahead, one of our dedicated client managers will send out a contract to be signed electronically. In addition to that, we will send you our welcome letter which contains information pertaining to a general insurance claim, as well as a limited Power of Attorney, which allows us to endorse checks submitted from the insurance company to allow us to expedite payments to vendors as needed, including Ayzertech’s commission. At the same time, we will email you requesting specific information pertaining to the claim that we need to help represent you to the insurance company.

                                <p>
                                    After the contract has been signed, we will send our Letter of Representation over to the Insurance company and to the adjuster assigned by the insurance company. Relax, while we handle the negotiations; in most cases, there will be nothing else needed from you unless specifically indicated by the insurance company. If anything is needed, we will contact you right away to ensure your claim is handled swiftly and efficiently.

                                <p>
                                    Mitigation and/or the hiring of experts are an absolute necessity for every insurance claim; for without proper mitigation and inspection, the insurance company has a right to deny the insurance claim. We have many deep relationships with vendors across the country and would be happy to assist in finding the right match for you and your specific needs. Usually, in the case of a typical loss, mitigation should be brought in as soon as possible; please reach out to our office so that we may coordinate this aspect of your claim.
                                </p>

                                    Insurance companies have strict requirements regarding how a loss must be documented. These requirements vary by company and by adjuster assigned to each claim.  As in most claims, it becomes necessary for Ayzertech to be your eyes and ears and understand exactly what occurred during the period of loss. A member of our team will travel to the job site as soon as possible to properly document the loss through various specialized software and industry approved equipment, to ensure we have everything we need to make our case to the insurance company. 
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    We will handle all meetings and negotiations throughout the entire process from beginning to end. Sometimes, it works out that when we make our trip to visit the job site, that the insurance company’s adjuster meets us onsite. We work closely with them to determine the extent and coverage of the damages and will consult you or a member of your company as to how to conduct yourself during that inspection. Rest assured that Ayzertech will always have your best interests in mind.
                                </p>

                                    After speaking with the adjuster and completing our investigation, we will calculate an estimate based on our observations that will be bolstered by local experts if deemed necessary. We will then present our estimate to the insurance company with all the appropriate documentation to clearly show how your coverage applies to your claim. Throughout our constant communication with the insurance company, we then negotiate on your behalf to reach a fair and equitable settlement. We pride ourselves on our strong relationships with insurance company adjusters across the country. Oftentimes, if we are involved from the beginning, negotiations go smoothly; although sometimes there are instances where we do not always see eye to eye with the insurance companies and/or their representatives. When this occurs, our experience is key. We understand how to manage the escalation process and have various tools at our disposal to ensure that you are being taken care of. We will be in touch with you if other methods of settlement become necessary such as arbitration, appraisal, or litigation; and have many experts at our disposal to assist throughout these processes.

                                <p>
                                    Once we reach a settlement with the insurance company, the checks will be mailed to our office for processing and distribution. Often, we are authorized to pay the vendors directly, so you do not have to worry about anything else and can focus on rebuilding from the loss. After your claim is paid, our work is done and we always remain just a phone call or email away. Please do not hesitate to contact us regarding any questions or clarifications throughout the entire process. Thank you for being a valued client and we hope to assist you in the future if the need ever arises!
